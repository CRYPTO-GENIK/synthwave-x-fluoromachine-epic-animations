<br/><br/>

*This is a fork of webrender/synthwave-x-fluoromachine, wich is also fork of @robbowen's [Synthwave '84 theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode), merged with @fullerenedream's [Fluoromachine](https://colorsublime.github.io/themes/FluoroMachine/) theme for VSCode.*

## Installation 

• install this theme  
• install [Custom CSS and JS Loader](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=be5invis.vscode-custom-css)  
• link the CSS file from this extension in your .vscode/settings.json: 

```
On Mac it might look something like the snippet below:

{
  "vscode_custom_css.imports": [
    "file:///Users/{your username}/.vscode/extensions/thecodemonkey.synthwave-x-fluoromachine-epic-animations-1.0.1/synthwave-x-fluoromachine.css",
    "file:///Users/{your username}/.vscode/extensions/thecodemonkey.synthwave-x-fluoromachine-epic-animations-1.0.1/epic-80s-transitions.css"
    ]
}

Windows might resemble:

{
  "vscode_custom_css.imports": [
    "file:///C:/Users/{your username}/.vscode/extensions/thecodemonkey.synthwave-x-fluoromachine-epic-animations-1.0.1/synthwave-x-fluoromachine.css",
    "file:///C:/Users/{your username}/.vscode/extensions/thecodemonkey.synthwave-x-fluoromachine-epic-animations-1.0.1/epic-80s-transitions.css"
    ]
}
```

• epic-80s-transitions.css is optional and brings crazy 80's animations into your VS code!

• From the command panel, select `Reload Custom CSS and JS`. You'll need to run this command every time vscode updates.
